Testing forms always seems to be a pain, especially when they have multiple steps. The worst part is when you have to fill out all the fields, because they are required.

A while back I came across this little snippet. It lets you unrequire all the fields from the form that is on the current page. All you need to do is add this to your `functions.php`. Anytime you are logged into the site, you won't be required to fill out any of the fields.
