This is a place to:

- Meet fellow web professionals

This site is an all-in-one resource for all things web design and development in central Iowa. At its most basic level, the Des Moines Web Collective is a community, existing both online and offline, connecting like-minded professionals. As a collaborative resource, its continued success relies on you to help maintain, add and remove content - including groups, events, jobs and resources.
