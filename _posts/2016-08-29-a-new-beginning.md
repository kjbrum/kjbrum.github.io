Today, I officially started my new job working as an Interactive Front-End Developer for [Sandbox](http://sandboxww.com) at the Des Moines office.

Over the past 7 months, I was working as the Web Strategist at [SparkReaction](http://sparkreaction.com), an inbound marketing agency. This was quite a new position for me, as I hadn't done much project management or strategy work in the past, at least not "officially". I was excited to be doing something different from development, which is what I have primarily done in my past positions. I loved the idea of getting a different perspective on processes and expanding my skillsets a bit.

Unfortunately, after a few months, there was a void forming in my life. I missed building cool shit. Don't get me wrong, I got to work on some cool projects, but I didn't get to build them, as if they were _my_ project. Personally, I love being able to take a project from design to production and owning it throughout the process.

That being said, I haven't been doing a very good job of writing the past few months and am hoping to start doing it regularly again. I find I have a lot more to write about (development wise) when I am writing code every day, running into issues, fixing bugs, and learning new stuff.

I am hoping to get my hands dirty with non-development work as well, so keep an eye on my [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/kjbrum) for updates!
