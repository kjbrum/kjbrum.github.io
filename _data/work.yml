Users needed to be able to sign up for the event, create or join a bowling team, and collect donations for the cause. Many of the front facing pages are just simple WordPress pages, the real magic was on the team and player pages. Each team and player has their own profile page, which they are able to share on social media to allow friends/family to donate."

  description: "This was the largest and most content heavy website I have worked on to date. The site was built using WordPress. I built most of the front-end functionality, being sure to make things as modular as possible, so they could easily be reused throughout the site. I also helped out with some of the back-end functionality, including their custom ad plugin, conference pages, and product pages. Having to transfer so much content from one site to another, this was a fun project to be able to write some Bash scripts using the WP-CLI to handle the migration."
